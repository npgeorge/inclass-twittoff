heroku deployment steps

navigate to root directory

git remote -v
    this will show the current origin link to github repo

ensure you are in root directory of your heroku app

/Users/ngeorge/Documents/Lambda/Sprint_3/Unit_3/inclass-twittoff
    this is the location of my app

heroku create inclass-twittoff
    this created the repo on heroku

git remote -v
    passing this command in again will show the association now between your heroku app and github
    for example:

    heroku	https://git.heroku.com/inclass-twittoff.git (fetch)
    heroku	https://git.heroku.com/inclass-twittoff.git (push)
    origin	https://github.com/npgeorge/inclass-twittoff.git (fetch)
    origin	https://github.com/npgeorge/inclass-twittoff.git (push)   


git push heroku master
    this will push your current origin github files to heroku


heroku logs --tail
    outputs logs for debugging
